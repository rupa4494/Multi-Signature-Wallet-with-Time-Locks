# Multi-Signature Wallet with Time Locks

## Project Description

The Multi-Signature Wallet with Time Locks is an advanced smart contract solution designed to provide maximum security for cryptocurrency asset management on the Ethereum blockchain. This innovative wallet system requires multiple authorized signatures before executing any transaction, combined with time-delayed execution for high-value transfers to prevent unauthorized access and impulsive financial decisions.

Built with enterprise-grade security principles, this wallet eliminates single points of failure by distributing transaction approval authority among multiple trusted parties. The integrated time lock mechanism adds an additional security layer, ensuring that large transactions undergo a mandatory waiting period, allowing owners time to review and potentially cancel suspicious activities.

The smart contract is architected for organizations, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), cryptocurrency funds, and security-conscious individuals who require shared custody solutions with transparent governance and accountability.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize cryptocurrency custody by creating the most secure, transparent, and user-friendly multi-signature wallet solution in the blockchain ecosystem. We envision a future where:

- **Decentralized Security**: Every cryptocurrency holder can access institutional-grade security without relying on centralized custodial services
- **Transparent Governance**: All transaction decisions are recorded on-chain, creating an immutable audit trail for complete accountability
- **Collaborative Finance**: Teams and organizations can manage shared treasuries with confidence, knowing that no single individual can compromise the funds
- **Risk Mitigation**: Time-delayed execution prevents both external attacks and internal threats by providing cooling-off periods for all significant transactions
- **Democratic Money Management**: Financial decisions require consensus, promoting responsible spending and investment practices

We aim to become the standard solution for secure cryptocurrency custody, empowering millions of users worldwide to take full control of their digital assets while maintaining the highest security standards.

## Key Features

const requiredSignatures = 2;

// Deploy the wallet
const wallet = await Project.deploy(owners, requiredSignatures);

// Propose a transaction
const txId = await wallet.proposeTransaction(
    "0xRecipient...", 
    ethers.utils.parseEther("0.5"), 
    "0x"
);

// Sign the transaction (requires 2 signatures)
await wallet.connect(owner1).signTransaction(txId);
await wallet.connect(owner2).signTransaction(txId);

// Execute the transaction
